# Tutorials

## Why build tutorials?

Tutorials enable the fast transfer of knowledge from one group of individuals to another. In our case, from the Miden core developers to potential users or contributors/developers. Tutorials, if done correctly, can be an effective way to speed up the onboarding of target audiences and foster ecosystem growth. On the other hand, tutorials, if poorly realized, can be a source of frustration and lead to loss of target audience.

### Tutorials in blockchain?

Especially in deep-tech industries like blockchain, we need to be able to explain complex topics simply, enabling the onboarding of new users and developers. This is a complex but essential task for the success of any tech-focused project. You can have the best technology or product, but if nobody is able to use or understand it, it is ultimately rendered useless and userless.

## Tutorial ideas & Examples

Some tutorial ideas in the context of Miden:

- How to create a Miden account?
- Your first transaction on Miden
- The architecture of the Miden protocol
- Update and upgrade your Miden account
- Deploy your first smart contract on Miden
- How does Miden work?
- Miden and privacy

## Tutorial goals and targets

Tutorials can have different goals and targets. In the context of Miden, our goals are:

- Onboard new users
- Onboard new developers

Hence, these are our two target personas.

## Categories of tutorials

Taking inspiration from the previously mentioned ideas and examples, we can notice that the tutorials can be grouped into different categories:

- User-oriented => protocol user; send/receive funds, interact with DApps, benefit from privacy
- Developer-oriented => protocol developer; build DApps, deploy smart contracts, contribute to core
- Action-oriented => Walks you through doing something; e.g., How to create a Miden account
- Knowledge-oriented => Teaches you about something; e.g., Miden architecture deep dive

From these different categories, we can derive a table giving examples of tutorials that we could make for different personas having different goals:

| Role      | Action                                  | Knowledge                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| User      | How to create a Miden account           | Privacy scales better        |
| Developer | How to deploy your first smart contract | Miden architecture deep dive |

Hence, we understand that there are a few important questions that need to be answered before making a tutorial:

- Who is our target? This will define the level of abstraction required.
- What is their goal? This will define the type of tutorial, i.e., action or knowledge-oriented.

## Mediums of tutorials

Nowadays, there are multiple mediums that can be used to make a compelling tutorial:

- Video, e.g., YouTube (long format), TikTok (short format)
- Audio, e.g., podcast
- Blog, i.e., general purpose (short format, abstracted)
- Documentation, i.e., developer-focused (long format, comprehensive)
- Social media post, e.g., Twitter, Instagram (short format, condensed)

The selection of the medium depends on the awaited results and specific target, e.g., low number of developers on Instagram but many potential users.

## What makes a good tutorial?

Understanding the criteria that make a compelling tutorial is essential to be able to achieve the set goal. We list here some of those criteria:

- Easily understandable; digestible content, targeted level of abstraction
- Achieves set goal; e.g., How to create a Miden account, at the end of the tutorial you should have a functional Miden account
- Tutorial solves a pain point or goal of the target; i.e., you might not need a tutorial for something that is self-evident
- Targeted length; maximizes target retention
- Targeted medium; maximizes target reach
- Accessibility considerations; ensures the tutorial is usable by people with different abilities

## Measuring tutorial effectiveness

To ensure our tutorials are meeting their goals, we should implement ways to measure their effectiveness:

- User feedback surveys
- Completion rates
- Time spent on tutorial
- Number of users who take further action (e.g., create an account, deploy a contract) after completing the tutorial

## Iterative improvement process

Creating effective tutorials is an ongoing process. We should:

1. Create initial tutorials based on our understanding of user needs
2. Gather feedback through surveys and analytics
3. Identify areas for improvement
4. Update and refine tutorials
5. Repeat the process regularly

Using these heuristics and processes, we can start building and continuously improving compelling tutorials, maximizing the reach and acquisition of both Miden targets, i.e., protocol users and developers.
