<h2 id="blockchains-as-payment-infrastructure"><a class="header" href="#blockchains-as-payment-infrastructure">Blockchains as Payment Infrastructure</a></h2>
<p>Efficient payments are the economic backbone of human societies. They enable the exchange of value for goods and services, facilitate social functioning (e.g., participating in activities like dining out), and support financial interactions.</p>
<p>Since the inception of Bitcoin, the first blockchain, payments have been the flagship use case. With further developments like Ethereum, alternative L1s (Polygon, Tron, Celo, BNB), and innovations like rollups (Base, Starknet, Scroll), payments have become faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>The lowered transaction fees offered by these alternative chains make them more suitable for routine, person-to-person payments and small-scale commercial transactions. This "real-world" adoption is evident from <a href="https://app.artemisanalytics.com/stablecoins?chain=all&amp;stablecoinMetric=STABLECOIN_MC">data on stablecoin usage across these chains</a>. The term "real world" in this context refers primarily to user-to-user transfers, as opposed to institutional transactions. This interpretation is supported by the notably lower average transaction sizes compared to Ethereum (~$15 vs ~$100k).</p>
<p>While blockchains have vastly improved through the introduction of alternative layer-1 and layer-2 solutions, three critical issues continue to prevent mass adoption:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>scalability</strong>: Despite technological advancements, many blockchains remain to slow and expensive to use at scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong>: Most blockchain networks still operate on a public ledger system, where all transactions are visible and traceable. The lack of built-in privacy features means that financial transactions lack the confidentiality that users expect from financial systems. This transparency, while beneficial for some use cases, poses significant concerns for personal and business transactions that require discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Experience (UI/UX)</strong>: Blockchain applications still suffer from poor UI/UX design. The complexity of interacting with blockchain systems remains a significant barrier for non-technical users, often involving confusing wallet interfaces, complicated address systems, sensitive seed phrases and unintuitive transaction processes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These issues have prevented blockchains from acquiring the role of leading payment infrastructure and forced users to continue relying on classical centralized infrastructures (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Venmo, Revolut, banks, etc.).</p>
<p>This raises the question: <em>What about current private decentralized systems?</em></p>
<p>While decentralized privacy-preserving protocols like <a href="https://z.cash">Zcash</a> and <a href="https://getmonero.org">Monero</a> exist, they face significant limitations. These systems lack stable assets, exclusively using their native tokens (ZEC and XMR), which prevents the use of widely adopted stablecoins like USDC or USDT. This absence of stable, pegged currencies hinders real-world transactions and broad adoption. Additionally, their transaction fees (Zcash: $0.023, Monero: $0.061), while seemingly low, are still too high to compete effectively with traditional payment systems or newer blockchain solutions.</p>
<p>Miden solves these issues.</p>
<h2 id="miden-an-improved-payment-infrastructure"><a class="header" href="#miden-an-improved-payment-infrastructure">Miden: an improved payment infrastructure</a></h2>
<p>Given the limitations of existing blockchains and payments infrastructure, both public and privacy-focused, there is a clear need for a solution that combines scalability, privacy, and functionality. This is where Miden enters the picture. By building on the foundational work around privacy of projects like Zcash and Monero and around computation of a project like Ethereum, while also incorporating lessons learned from scalable solutions like rollups, Miden presents a promising approach towards building a more ideal payments infrastructure:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Current Systems</th><th>Miden</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Network Structure</td><td>Centralized</td><td>Decentralized (On the roadmap)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Asset Support</td><td>Lack of stable assets</td><td>Arbitrary assets</td></tr>
<tr><td>Privacy</td><td>Public</td><td>Private</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cost</td><td>Expensive</td><td>Cheap</td></tr>
<tr><td>Speed</td><td>Slow</td><td>Fast</td></tr>
<tr><td>User Experience</td><td>Poor UX</td><td>Abstracted UX (Applications)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The Miden protocol gives us the best of all worlds by addressing each of the key issues identified in current systems.</p>
<h2 id="payments-using-the-miden-protocol"><a class="header" href="#payments-using-the-miden-protocol">Payments using the Miden protocol</a></h2>
<p>Miden enables users to perform <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-miden-transaction-model-2">peer-to-peer private transfers</a> using local execution and local proving. Here is an example of it step by step:</p>
<p>We agree on the following initial state:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 2 users, Alice and Bob</li>
<li>Alice owns 1 Ether, Bob owns no assets</li>
<li>Alice wants to send 1 Ether to Bob</li>
<li>Alice and Bob want to remain private</li>
</ul>
<p>To do so, the following scheme can be applied:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alice transitions her state from a state <code>S</code> where she has <code>1 Ether</code> to a state <code>S'</code> where she has <code>0 Ether</code>, transferring the asset into a <code>Note</code> using the <a href="https://github.com/0xPolygonMiden/miden-base/blob/main/miden-lib/asm/note_scripts/P2ID.masm">P2ID script</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice transfers this <code>Note</code> containing the asset to Bob using arbitrary solutions (Signal, E-mail, On-chain encrypted notes (on the roadmap)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob receives the <code>Note</code> and transitions his state from <code>S</code> where he has <code>0 Ether</code> to a state <code>S'</code> where he has <code>1 Ether</code>, consuming the <code>1 Ether</code> placed into the <code>Note</code> by Alice into his state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-powerful-payment-application-on-miden"><a class="header" href="#a-powerful-payment-application-on-miden">A powerful payment application on Miden</a></h2>
<p>Leveraging the Miden primitives mentioned above, we can imagine a powerful payment application that would combine privacy, fast and cheap payments, a stunning user interface, great user experience while being built on top of a fully permissionless and decentralized infrastructure, Miden. The following features would be required:</p>
<ul>
<li>A modern, simple and clean UI</li>
<li>Ability to make transfers in a fast, cheap and privacy preserving way</li>
<li>Ability to create accounts with a simple onboarding flow (abstracted seed phrases/UX)</li>
<li>Built on top of Miden</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking inspiration from successful payment applications (e.i. Venmo or Revolut), we would prioritize simplicity and cleanliness for the interface, making the application approachable for users of any technical level. We can imagine a frontend that would aggregate all user assets and transfers, display a portfolio value and enable transfers:</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="novel_applications/payment/../../assets/images/payment_application.png" width="40%" alt="Imagined payment app">
</p>
<p>We could imagine additional features which could be added to this type of application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple DeFi page, aggregating best sources of yield / lending / borrowing from different Miden protocols</li>
<li>Phone-to-phone tap payment</li>
<li>Creation of digital bank cards and integration with Apple / Google Pay</li>
<li>Creation of physical bank cards (Gnosis card, Crypto.com card, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Miden represents a significant leap forward in blockchain-based payment systems, addressing key limitations of existing solutions. By combining privacy, programmability, and scalability, it opens the door to user-friendly applications that could revolutionize how we transact, as presented above.</p>

<h4 id="a-better-ux-on-miden-account-abstraction"><a class="header" href="#a-better-ux-on-miden-account-abstraction">A better UX on Miden: Account abstraction</a></h4>
<p><em>Question: Why would a user have a better UX on Miden than on another blockchain?</em></p>
<p>Ethereum has set the standard for accounts in the VM-enabled blockchain world. There are two types of accounts in Ethereum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Externally owned accounts (EOA): are created by generating a public/private ECDSA key pair. Does not hold code. Can initiate transactions.</li>
<li>Contract accounts (Smart contracts): are created by being deployed on the Ethereum blockchain by an EOA. Holds code which can be executed. Can't initiate transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We clearly understand here that Ethereum has made the choice to separate user accounts from executable code. What if we could merge both to enable programmable user accounts? Welcoming <code>Account abstraction</code>, which can be defined as follows:</p>
<p>"Account abstraction is a method of setting up a blockchain network in which users' assets are stored exclusively in smart contracts, and not in external accounts (External Owned Accounts, EOAs). When using this approach, a crypto wallet turns into a unique smart contract that can be programmed for various purposes."</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@alex-100/what-is-account-abstraction-and-why-is-it-important-9627a4ced4f3">What is account abstraction and why is it important - Medium - Aleksander</a></p>
<p>Miden supports full account abstraction, enabling full programmability of user <a href="https://docs.polygon.technology/miden/miden-base/architecture/accounts/">accounts</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>Miden VM code</code> field hints that all Miden accounts are <code>abstracted</code>, which enables arbitrary logic to be executed against them, opening the door to unbounded functionalities. Using these innovations, we can imagine improvements in UX like social recovery, abstracted seed phrases, Face-ID signing, and many more.</p>

<p>The user account, assets and private key would be stored securely on device. For additional redundancy, we could add social recovery solutions, storage of an encrypted account state in the cloud, and more.</p>
<h4 id="secure-enclave-and-keystore"><a class="header" href="#secure-enclave-and-keystore">Secure enclave and Keystore</a></h4>
<p><em>Question: I don't really know what a private key is and it seems too important for me to store it safely, how can I do it?</em></p>
<p>To make the user onboarding seamless, we would want to abstract away seed phrases and complex blockchain security measures. We could achieve this using the secure element of modern phones which stores key-pairs in trusted execution environments (TEEs) enabling signatures. They are currently used for face or finger recognition, login, WebAuthn, payment and more:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/sec59b0b31ff/web">Secure enclave</a> for Apple phones</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore">Keystore</a> for Android phones</li>
</ul>
<p>To leverage these secure elements in Miden, we would need to implement signature verification for their supported signature schemes. A signature scheme supported by both of these secure elements is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA</a>. <a href="https://github.com/0xPolygonMiden/miden-vm/blob/4923e3d69622e6b8a5d91fab2949cb83845cf134/stdlib/tests/crypto/ecdsa_secp256k1.rs">ECDSA signature verification</a> support on Miden would enable users to sign Miden transactions using their phones' face / finger recognition, password, etc., making the onboarding flow simpler.</p>
<h4 id="the-relayer"><a class="header" href="#the-relayer">The relayer</a></h4>
<p><em>Question: Considering that the transactions are made locally by the users, how would notes be handled and delivered to the recipients?</em></p>
<p>Relaying could be handled in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Off-chain relaying: the application or external actors could provide relaying services for the notes of the users (losing privacy against the relayer)</li>
<li>On-chain relaying: the users could use on-chain encrypted notes to interact with other users (on the roadmap)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first method could be assimilated with a <code>PUSH</code> scheme where the source would send their notes to the relayer and the relayer would send those notes to the intended target. The second method could be assimilated as a <code>PULL</code> scheme where the source would encrypt notes and send them to the Miden rollup. The application would then need to filter existing notes from the rollup notes tree and consume relevant notes for the target user (which could be done on action or time basis).</p>
<h4 id="miden-name-service"><a class="header" href="#miden-name-service">Miden name service</a></h4>
<p><em>Question: How would I easily find and interact with my contacts if addresses are a bunch of random characters starting with <code>0x</code>?</em></p>
<p>To simplify the addition and management of contacts and make the experience more recognizable by web2 users, we could improve the address book of the application by leveraging <a href="novel_applications/payment/">Miden name service</a>. A name service is essential for users to easily find, send and remember contacts (We do not store phone numbers as numbers in our phones, we store them as names, attached is the phone number e.g. Mom -&gt; +123456789).</p>
<h4 id="users-need-to-sign-a-transaction-for-each-action"><a class="header" href="#users-need-to-sign-a-transaction-for-each-action">Users need to sign a transaction for each action</a></h4>
<p><em>Question: Wouldn't I have a bad experience needing to sign each and every action I make inside the application?</em></p>
<p>Most web3 apps forced their users to sign a transaction for each of their actions because each state update of a blockchain requires a valid account signature. We can solve this using these two solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Batching of user actions: User actions can be batched and do not need to be sent on each action.</li>
<li>Hybrid web2 / web3 apps: Not everything needs to live on-chain, the application developer can handle some of the actions on a classic web2 backend, while the users keep sovereignty over their assets and data in a web3 way.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-about-fees"><a class="header" href="#what-about-fees">What about fees?</a></h4>
<p><em>Question: Wouldn't I need to pay a lot in fees for each transaction?</em></p>
<p>Any digital system incurs costs, be it centralized or decentralized. The cost of the material, running the software, employees, offices, etc. The default behavior for web2 applications is to subsidize these costs for their users, making the use of the service free and finding other ways to make profit. Current blockchains (web3) impose gas fees on their users relative to their computational use of the system. This payment of fees on each action has made the user experience and the cost to use blockchain systems higher than their web2 counterparts, hindering the adoption of blockchain-based applications.</p>
<p>Miden's account abstraction solves this by enabling application developers to subsidize gas costs for their users through a <a href="https://www.stackup.sh/blog/what-are-paymasters">paymaster</a> scheme. Furthermore, the cost incurred by fees on Miden would be small; thanks to <a href="novel_applications/payment/private_payment.html#privacy-scales-better">private scaling</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-1-to-n-payment-and-why-is-it-powerful"><a class="header" href="#what-is-1-to-n-payment-and-why-is-it-powerful">What is 1-to-n Payment and Why is it Powerful?</a></h2>
<p>1-to-n private payment is a powerful primitive enabling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consolidation of multiple payments in a single transaction</li>
<li>Increased privacy for all involved parties</li>
<li>Reduced processing time</li>
<li>Reduced complexity of tasks and possibility of errors</li>
<li>Reduced administrative costs</li>
</ul>
<p>The use cases for 1-to-n payments are diverse, encompassing a wide range of financial operations. These include user payments, large-scale corporation payrolls, and document, ticket, and NFT issuance, among others.</p>
<p>1-to-n payment would enable actors from individual users to large corporations to benefit from a better payment primitive.</p>
<h3 id="1-to-n-payments-for-companies"><a class="header" href="#1-to-n-payments-for-companies">1-to-n Payments for Companies</a></h3>
<p>Historically, companies have struggled with payroll management, especially as they scale. As organizations grow to encompass hundreds or thousands of employees, suppliers, and partners, managing numerous payments becomes increasingly complex and expensive. Traditional methods, whether manual or automated, often result in time-consuming processes, higher error rates, and significant administrative costs.</p>
<p>1-to-n payments offer a solution for companies of all sizes. Using Miden, businesses can now fulfill <strong>ALL</strong> of their required payments in <strong>ONE SINGLE TRANSACTION</strong>. This approach eliminates the need for individual transfers, dramatically reducing processing time, minimizing errors, and cutting transaction costs.</p>
<h3 id="private-payments-for-companies"><a class="header" href="#private-payments-for-companies">Private Payments for Companies</a></h3>
<p>Private payments are not just essential in human societies, <a href="novel_applications/payment/./private_payment.html">learn more</a>; they are crucial for the functioning of modern businesses. While individuals value financial privacy, companies depend on it for their survival and growth in competitive markets.</p>
<p>Companies rely on private payments for several reasons, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining competitive advantages by keeping financial strategies confidential</li>
<li>Protecting intellectual property related to research and development investments</li>
<li>Ensuring market stability by preventing unintended reactions to large transactions</li>
<li>Payment of employees, suppliers, and partners</li>
<li>And many more</li>
</ul>
<p>By maintaining privacy in their financial transactions, companies can operate more effectively in competitive business environments. This privacy does not exist in current payment systems, nor in the classical banking infrastructure, nor in current blockchains. Miden brings a solution to this problem through private transactions.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-miden-enable-1-to-n-payments"><a class="header" href="#how-does-miden-enable-1-to-n-payments">How Does Miden Enable 1-to-n Payments?</a></h2>
<p>Miden enables the consumption and generation of an arbitrary number of <a href="https://docs.polygon.technology/miden/miden-base/architecture/notes/">notes</a> (now ~1000 - artificially constrained). Each of these notes can be public or private and be used to transition a user's account from a state <code>S</code> to a state <code>S'</code>.</p>
<p>We agree on the following initial state:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 11 users, one is Alice</li>
<li>Alice owns <code>10 Ether</code></li>
<li>Alice wants to send <code>1 Ether</code> to each other user</li>
<li>Alice wants to remain private</li>
</ul>
<p>The process works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alice transitions her state from a state <code>S</code> where she has <code>10 Ether</code> to a state <code>S'</code> where she has <code>0 Ether</code> left. Generating 10 different <code>Notes</code> with 10 different recipients, being each other user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice transfers these <code>Notes</code> containing the assets to the other users using a private arbitrary solution (On-chain encrypted notes (on the roadmap), Telegram, Signal, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other users each receive the <code>Note</code> and transition their individual states from <code>S</code> where they have <code>x Ether</code> to <code>S'</code> where they have <code>x+1 Ether</code>, consuming the <code>1 Ether</code> placed into the <code>Note</code> by Alice into their own states.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Leveraging the primitives mentioned above, we can imagine a powerful 1-to-n payment app that would enable companies of all sizes to manage their payments in an elegant, private, fast, cheap, streamlined way, built on top of Miden's infrastructure.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from applications that could leverage 1-to-n payment like <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/">TicketMaster</a> or <a href="https://wind.app/developer">Wind</a>, we can imagine a simple and modern dashboard enabling multiple payments or document issuance at once.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-1"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-1">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The introduction of 1-to-n private payments on Miden offers a solution to long-lasting payment challenges faced by corporations and individuals. By providing efficiency, reduced costs, error minimization, privacy, and the ability to consolidate transactions, 1-to-n payments could enhance how individuals and companies manage financial operations.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tutorials"><a class="header" href="#tutorials">Tutorials</a></h1>
<p>Our tutorials help users and developers get accustomed with the usage of the Miden protocol. Following is our philosophy around tutorial building.</p>
<h2 id="why-build-tutorials"><a class="header" href="#why-build-tutorials">Why build tutorials?</a></h2>
<p>Tutorials enable the fast transfer of knowledge from one group of individuals to another. In our case, from the Miden core developers to potential users or contributors/developers. Tutorials, if done correctly, can be an effective way to speed up the onboarding of target audiences and foster ecosystem growth. On the other hand, tutorials, if poorly realized, can be a source of frustration and lead to loss of target audience.</p>
<h3 id="tutorials-in-blockchain"><a class="header" href="#tutorials-in-blockchain">Tutorials in blockchain?</a></h3>
<p>Especially in deep-tech industries like blockchain, we need to be able to explain complex topics simply, enabling the onboarding of new users and developers. This is a complex but essential task for the success of any tech-focused project. You can have the best technology or product, but if nobody is able to use or understand it, it is ultimately rendered useless and userless.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-ideas--examples"><a class="header" href="#tutorial-ideas--examples">Tutorial ideas &amp; Examples</a></h2>
<p>Some tutorial ideas in the context of Miden:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a Miden account?</li>
<li>Your first transaction on Miden</li>
<li>The architecture of the Miden protocol</li>
<li>Update and upgrade your Miden account</li>
<li>Deploy your first smart contract on Miden</li>
<li>How does Miden work?</li>
<li>Miden and privacy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tutorial-goals-and-targets"><a class="header" href="#tutorial-goals-and-targets">Tutorial goals and targets</a></h2>
<p>Tutorials can have different goals and targets. In the context of Miden, our goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Onboard new users</li>
<li>Onboard new developers</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, these are our two target personas.</p>
<h2 id="categories-of-tutorials"><a class="header" href="#categories-of-tutorials">Categories of tutorials</a></h2>
<p>Taking inspiration from the previously mentioned ideas and examples, we can notice that the tutorials can be grouped into different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>User-oriented =&gt; protocol user; send/receive funds, interact with DApps, benefit from privacy</li>
<li>Developer-oriented =&gt; protocol developer; build DApps, deploy smart contracts, contribute to core</li>
<li>Action-oriented =&gt; Walks you through doing something; e.g., How to create a Miden account</li>
<li>Knowledge-oriented =&gt; Teaches you about something; e.g., Miden architecture deep dive</li>
</ul>
<p>From these different categories, we can derive a table giving examples of tutorials that we could make for different personas having different goals:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th>Action</th><th>Knowledge</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>User</td><td>How to create a Miden account</td><td>Privacy scales better</td></tr>
<tr><td>Developer</td><td>How to deploy your first smart contract</td><td>Miden architecture deep dive</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Hence, we understand that there are a few important questions that need to be answered before making a tutorial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is our target? This will define the level of abstraction required.</li>
<li>What is their goal? This will define the type of tutorial, i.e., action or knowledge-oriented.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mediums-of-tutorials"><a class="header" href="#mediums-of-tutorials">Mediums of tutorials</a></h2>
<p>Nowadays, there are multiple mediums that can be used to make a compelling tutorial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video, e.g., YouTube (long format), TikTok (short format)</li>
<li>Audio, e.g., podcast</li>
<li>Blog, i.e., general purpose (short format, abstracted)</li>
<li>Documentation, i.e., developer-focused (long format, comprehensive)</li>
<li>Social media post, e.g., Twitter, Instagram (short format, condensed)</li>
</ul>
<p>The selection of the medium depends on the awaited results and specific target, e.g., low number of developers on Instagram but many potential users.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-tutorial"><a class="header" href="#what-makes-a-good-tutorial">What makes a good tutorial?</a></h2>
<p>Understanding the criteria that make a compelling tutorial is essential to be able to achieve the set goal. We list here some of those criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily understandable; digestible content, targeted level of abstraction</li>
<li>Achieves set goal; e.g., How to create a Miden account, at the end of the tutorial you should have a functional Miden account</li>
<li>Tutorial solves a pain point or goal of the target; i.e., you might not need a tutorial for something that is self-evident</li>
<li>Targeted length; maximizes target retention</li>
<li>Targeted medium; maximizes target reach</li>
<li>Accessibility considerations; ensures the tutorial is usable by people with different abilities</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measuring-tutorial-effectiveness"><a class="header" href="#measuring-tutorial-effectiveness">Measuring tutorial effectiveness</a></h2>
<p>To ensure our tutorials are meeting their goals, we should implement ways to measure their effectiveness:</p>
<ul>
<li>User feedback surveys</li>
<li>Completion rates</li>
<li>Time spent on tutorial</li>
<li>Number of users who take further action (e.g., create an account, deploy a contract) after completing the tutorial</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iterative-improvement-process"><a class="header" href="#iterative-improvement-process">Iterative improvement process</a></h2>
<p>Creating effective tutorials is an ongoing process. We should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create initial tutorials based on our understanding of user needs</li>
<li>Gather feedback through surveys and analytics</li>
<li>Identify areas for improvement</li>
<li>Update and refine tutorials</li>
<li>Repeat the process regularly</li>
</ol>
<p>Using these heuristics and processes, we can start building and continuously improving compelling tutorials, maximizing the reach and acquisition of both Miden targets, i.e., protocol users and developers.</p>
